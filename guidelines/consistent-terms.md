# Consistent terms

Use the same terms consistently throughout your writing.

If you use the term “API endpoint” to refer to a specific interface, continue to use this term throughout the documentation.
Do not substitute another term, such as “web service” or “resource URL”.
Using a different term may cause the reader to wonder if you’re referring to the same thing.


## Examples

### 👍 Correct

* *The API endpoint returns a JSON response. To access the API endpoint, send a GET request.*
* *The build process compiles the source code. The build process also runs automated tests.*
* *The configuration file stores user preferences. Edit the configuration file to change settings.*

### 👎 Incorrect

* *The API endpoint returns a JSON response. To access the web service, send a GET request.*
* *The build process compiles the source code. The compilation step also runs automated tests.*
* *The configuration file stores user preferences. Edit the settings file to change options.*

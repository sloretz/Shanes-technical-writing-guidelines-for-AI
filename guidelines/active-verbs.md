# Active Verbs

Use the strongest, most direct form of the verb possible.

Avoid hidden verbs (nominalizations) in your writing.
Hidden verbs make sentences longer, weaker, and less direct.
Hidden verbs often appear with endings like -ment, -tion, -sion, or -ance, or with phrases like "make a decision" instead of "decide."

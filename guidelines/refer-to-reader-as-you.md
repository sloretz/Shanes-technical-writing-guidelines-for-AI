# Refer to the Reader as "You"

Any sentence that addresses the person reading the document must refer to the reader as "You".

Use "You" (second-person perspective) when writing instructions.
Avoid third-person perspective terms like "the user" or "the reader".
Second-person perspective makes it clear that the reader is supposed to follow those instructions.
Exceptions may apply in contexts where referring to a specific role or group is necessary for clarity.

### üëé Incorrect
